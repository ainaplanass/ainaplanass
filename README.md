## Hi, welcome!!!ðŸ˜Š

I am a junior game developer ðŸŽ® who recently graduated with a degree in video game design and production. Throughout my academic career, I have gained expertise in various areas of game development, allowing me to successfully work on projects as both a 2D and 3D programmer. I am also enthusiastic about exploring fullstack development and expanding my skills in that area. ðŸ’¡
